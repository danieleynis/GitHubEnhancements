## Install
You can find the Chrome extension on the Web Store by searching "GitHub Enhancements" or go to the extenstion directly [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-pr-links/cmgnbinjkbbijffcfebgohmopnffdidg?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)

## Features
- Add clickable links to branches that are references in a GitHub pull request. GitHub will tell you who wants to merge commits from one branch to another in a pull request but does not make the branch references clickable so they can take you directly to the branch that is referenced. I just want to have clickable links.
- Configure text that will be used to prefill pull requests body when you create new pull requests. In GitHub you need to create a file in the repositoy, with the extension you can just configure it and save it without having to pollute your repo with extra files.
