## Purpose and problem
The purpose of this chrome extension is to add clickable links to branches that are references in a GitHub pull request. GitHub will tell you who wants to merge commits from one branch to another in a pull request but does not make the branch references clickable so they can take you directly to the branch that is referenced. I just want to have clickable links.

## After
The branch names are now links which will take you directly to the branch in GitHub
